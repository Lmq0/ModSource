====
Main
--
A mod based on the Calamity. As you can see that many pictures are the same as the Calamity Mod, for I have no passion for painting new pictures. 
It is just a small mod made by myself for interest. There may be lots of mistakes and the method to write may seem strange.But afterall it can works.Maybe one day I will polish them
Looking forward to everybody's advice.

The Boss Actions

The Boss acts differently in part 1 and part 2.If Providence's Health is more than half of her Healthbar,she is in part 1.She have 3 different actions during that time.
First,the holy spear.
During that state,the boss will release fire ball in four directions.At the same time,there are four holy spear launched in another four directions.Before the spear launching,there will exist lines to help you avoid hit.
